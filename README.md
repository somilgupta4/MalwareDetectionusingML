This project is based on malware detection using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset used here consists of information about the PE files which will then be classified as benign and malicious using ML techniques. Firstly, feature extraction is performed on the data and only the important features are used for classification. Then, various classifiers like Random Forest, Gradient boosting are used for the classification purpose and the one providing high accuracy is taken into consideration.
